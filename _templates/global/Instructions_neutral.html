       Please read the general instructions below carefully. 
       After reading, you will be asked to answer a few questions to check your understanding.
       <br><br>

       You will complete <strong>three rounds</strong> of a task. You will find out more about the task shortly.
       In each round, you earn points based on how you perform.
        Each round uses a different rule to turn your points (and sometimes others' decisions) into pay.
